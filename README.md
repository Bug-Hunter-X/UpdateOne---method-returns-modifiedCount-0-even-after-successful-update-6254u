# MongoDB updateOne() method returns modifiedCount 0 even after successful update

This repository demonstrates a potential issue where the `updateOne()` method in MongoDB might return a `modifiedCount` of 0 even when a document has been successfully updated. This can happen due to various factors, such as incorrect filtering, upsert operations, or race conditions. The example provided shows a basic update operation that seemingly fails, yet the document is modified. 

## Solution
The solution focuses on confirming the update by querying the updated document after the `updateOne()` call to verify the changes.  Alternatively, more robust error handling is implemented to catch exceptions.
